Hello, my name is Daniel Robles-Hinckley. I am from Williamsburg, Virginia; however, I am studying at Virginia Tech to become a computer engineer. I am a transfer student, so I spent my first two years of college at Virginia Peninsula Community College, where I completed my Associate of Science in engineering, then transferred to Tech this year. I have always been fascinated by computers since I was young, and as I got older, this led me to wonder how they work and how I could modify them. I want to work for a large chip manufacturer like Intel, TSMC, or Micron in the future. I am fascinated by chip architecture and the manufacturing processes used to create computer chips. I hope this semester goes well and that I learn a lot in this class.
